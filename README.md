## My process

Structuring and implementing styles are becoming natural to do.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Box model. web page structuring.

### Continued development

Got to get more expertise when manipulating paddings and margins.

Future steps on my development roadmap is to be able to build a solid web app using front-end tech. So on, becoming a fullstack is the goal.

Everyday there's constant refining on HTML, CSS, JS.

After that react/node, database are coming next.

SwiftUI maybe?
